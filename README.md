# Cuts-and-Flows

Given a capacitated directed graph (where each edge has an integer capacity) with two distinguished vertices called source s and terminal t, our goal is to find an s-t flow with maximum value.
Consider the following examples of capacitated graphs: graph1 (four-vertex example) and graph2 (200-vertex example). Assume s and t are the vertices with smallest and largest indices, respectively. 
Both graphs are given in graphviz format where the labels denote the capacities of the directed edges.

Design a program to solve the maximum flow problem on integral capacitated graphs.
